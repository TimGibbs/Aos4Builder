No one really knows when ogors first picked up the cannons of their enemies, let alone how they learned how to fire them. Gnoblars were likely involved in teaching the finer points, or perhaps a leap of destructive genius was gifted to them by the Gulping God. Whatever the reason, a certain breed of ogor soon became besotted with the sheer carnage they could cause with their new toys, and they came to be known as Leadbelchers.\n\nWhenever a town or settlement is sacked, Leadbelchers hog as much blackpowder as they can. Finding actual cannonballs proves a lot harder, for handguns are a lot more common than artillery in the armies of men and even duardin. To make up for this, Leadbelchers stuff discarded weapons into the barrels of their cannons – when the blackpowder detonates, these are fired with terrific force into the ranks of the foe, often causing even more damage than a cannonball by shredding a wide spread of victims. Better yet, once the powder has run dry and the ogors have closed in, those cast-iron cannons make for excellent clubs…",

These members of the Gold College are often requested by the Freeguilds for their mastery over metals and arcane machinery, which proves to be more practical than the high arcane arts of other wizards. Through their magic, the resilience of the metal used by the God-King’s armies is multiplied many times over. Wrought iron becomes hard as duardin-worked gromril and shields become inviolable bulwarks. Meanwhile, enemies find their own armour transmuting into cumbersome lead, staggering them at the critical moment. Blade hilts suddenly burn white-hot, forcing their owners to drop them, whilst halberds find their biting edge drizzling away into molten slurry.\n\nThe signature artefact of the Alchemite Warforger’s profession is the massive crucible they bear at their side, a portable forge that contains the power of an inferno. Thick layers of leather protect them from the heat, but even veteran Alchemites must use long-handled tongs to bring out the runic cubes within. They use these cubes as lodestones that affect magical motes and the flow of the aether – simply by turning them this way and that, the Alchemite can melt metal around them until it flows at their command.",

A snivelling grot servant is always kept close at hand to carry a quiver full of spears on the orruk big shot’s behalf and help reload the Killbow all the faster after each bolt is loosed.

These champions do not manipulate aetheric energies in the manner of some craven mage; rather, they open their souls to the Blood God, becoming a conduit for his world-warping rage. Such contact with the furious divine would soon consume even the most fervent of worshippers. To bolster themselves, Slaughterpriests draw upon the power inherent in sacrifice; they will drink the blood of their victims and carve great wounds upon their own flesh.

The use of these painful projectiles speaks to the sadism of these shadowed warriors. The Darkshards often indulge in unnecessarily cruel behaviour in battle, such as intentionally trying to hamstring lesser foes and even shooting perilously close to human allies to create fear for their own enjoyment.

Should they succeed, a Rot Fly – a daemon formed from bitterness and rejection – will emerge from the Garden, consenting to serve as their mount. Blightlords are often curiously fond of their steed, even beyond the respect Nurgle’s champions habitually display for his daemons. To harm a Rot Fly spurs them into a gurgling rage – one that often ends in the offender being filled to bursting with daemonic mites and ticks.",

In life, he was Garradan of Demesnus, a Ghyranite healer, though when the Skinstealer tribe ransacked his city, he took up a four-foot iron candlestick in each hand to defend his patients. Sigmar looked well upon this deed and Reforged the healer into a warlord. It is an honour that Gardus has sometimes wondered if he is worthy of, but in truth, he has proved himself a hundred times over. He has braved the horrors of Nurgle’s Garden and faced down the daemon lord Be’lakor.

The manifestation of a Feculent Gnarlmaw can taint a land for years, turning it into a reflection-in-miniature of Nurgle’s Garden.\n\nFeculent Gnarlmaws emerge wherever Nurgle’s Maggotkin march in force, enticed by the vile scent of their souls. The noxious scents they emit and the clangour of the bells that hang from their limbs can cheer even the most despondent of Plaguebearers. Enemies are not so bolstered; inhaling even a single spore from a Gnarlmaw can compel an atrocious death as new forms of infernal foliage bloom inside their bodies and devour them from within.",

Expert marksmen of the Vanguard Auxiliary chambers, they are reclusive and insular by nature, chill-souled assassins who let their murderous efficiency speak for itself. Armed with an array of rapid-firing or pinpoint accurate crossbows, they wait for the most opportune moment before cutting down the foe in a hail of blistering but precisely delivered firepower. Those Vanguard-Raptors who wield hurricane crossbows are skilled at unleashing quick volleys of arrows at mid-range, shredding enemies in a single flurry of attacks.\n\nOf all the Stormcasts, Vanguard-Raptors are amongst the most detached from mortals; rarely do they walk amongst the free cities, preferring instead to remain amidst their lofty eyries until the call to the hunt is sounded. It is from these  isolated vantage points that they commune with the avian Aetherwings – fellow predators so alike in temperament that they and the Vanguard Raptors are often held to be kindred spirits. Certainly, many legends have attributed the almost preternatural aim possessed by the Raptors as much to a spiritual connection with the Aetherwings as to the Stormcasts’ own skill.",

Even after impact, these cosmic shards pulse with arcane power, disrupting nearby magics and incinerating anything in the vicinity. Mages attempting to harness the aetheric motes for spellcasting find their powers waning and their hostile spells unbound by the crackling energy. Weaker warriors simply disintegrate to dust, dead before they have even realised their own fate.",

At the beginning of a night’s death-games, they may fight a single snarling Frost Sabre, but such will soon be followed by a mob of captive orruks and a duo of rampaging Stegadons. They are their deity’s will made manifest, incarnated in each dazzling display of slaughter.\n\nThough High Gladiatrixes hold no formal position amongst the war covens, few of Morathi’s generals would deny their aid. They are one woman armies, wielding serpentine whips and blades to eviscerate their foes with a contemptuous flick of the wrist. Bands of Witch Aelves and Sisters of Slaughter flock to a High Gladiatrix’s presence, fighting with such fervour that it is said they would follow their idols into the Realm of Chaos itself. The crimson blessings that radiate from the High Gladiatrix intensify with each successive act of carnage until the battlefield is awash with gore.",

Rings of flame-licked spikes protrude from the ground around such a location, carved with runes in the dark tongue. Above the nexus point hangs a prism of enchanted stone – within languish daemonic entities that feed upon magical power drawn from the earth, pumping ruinous energies back into the negative space their hunger has created within the ley lines.\n\nThe creation of a Nexus Chaotica is always a calculated risk. For the corrupting effects of the shrine to take hold, its captive daemons must absorb the energies of the realms. As they do so, their desperation to escape sees their prison begin to splinter, pulsing with unpredictable energy. Yet the ability of a Nexus Chaotica to corrupt a wide swathe of land in short order cannot be underestimated.

So potent is this ire that it twists the world around a Bloodthirster. Jagged spires of brass erupt from the ground at their passing, and lakes of blood bubble in the craters left by their hooves. Each of these greater daemons belongs to one of eight hosts, with its own preferred methods of murder-making.

They are hurled into the choicest engagements, driving the god’s hosts to red victory through their own displays of slaughter. Bloodthirsters of a less favoured host often find themselves subordinate to a Wrath of Khorne, however much it rankles. With axe and flail swinging, hellfire spilling from its maw with each bellow, a Wrath of Khorne Bloodthirster is a tyrannical marshal indeed, but one who will make any sacrifice to excel under its master’s gaze.",

Many Daemonettes covet a Steed to carry them to new debaucheries, but to catch one of these creatures is near impossible. Instead, they must be lured in through the grisly sacrifice of prisoners or the scattering of jewels and scented oils; Steeds have swollen sensoriums and cannot help but investigate such appetising temptations, allowing the Daemonette to leap atop the beast and bind it to their will.\n\nSeekers of Slaanesh form the daemonic light cavalry of Slaanesh’s hosts and are capable of such bursts of speed that none can hope to outrun them. Many prey do not even see the lashing tongue or barbed claw that kills them. The Steeds of Slaanesh are tireless, allowing the Seekers to hunt their quarry over great distances. Often, the greatest difficulty for the Daemonette rider is not in giving chase to fleeing foes but rather in pulling their Steed’s attention away from the pursuit and rejoining the greater host.",

It is not unheard of for a gifted Sorcerer to command an entire host, however. As well as spreading sickness and despair with gusto, these forces delight in serving Nurgle through more esoteric means; they hunt down relics to corrupt, search for especially virulent plague ingredients and work to pollute the ley lines of power that race across the realms.",

But his soul was strong, its remnants lingering an age in the darkness of the void. Teclis recalled his friend’s sacrifice and was determined to save him. He recreated the warrior’s legendary Fangsword and armour before creating a doppelgänger to house Eltharion’s soul, yet this form burnt to ash upon coming into contact with that most luminous essence. However, Teclis’s grief turned to wonder as he watched the empty armour pulse with an inner glow, stirring and lifting a blade in salute. Eltharion walked once more, now a being of purest light bound into his enchanted plate.\n\nEltharion serves as the champion of the twin gods. He is a masterful duellist, striking and feinting in close combat as fluidly as the wind itself. Perhaps most crucially, his nature as a being of insubstantial light makes him almost impossible to destroy and allows him to venture into places so suffused with magic that they are lethal to mortalkind.",

Only the most iron-willed of warlords can collar a Manticore’s bloodthirsty frenzy and compel the beast to serve their purpose.

The gut-plates they wear tend to be more ornate than those of the Gluttons, and it is common practice for Ironguts to strap shields and bucklers taken from their downed foes to their torsos. These trophies are a welcome sign to their allies should a battle be going badly – for when the Ironguts smash into the press of battle, they can turn the tide of a fight all by themselves.",

So enthralling was their manner that, as the heinous festivities of the night intensified, the assembled libertines lathered them with attention. Infuriated, the master of the palace determined to slay all his sycophantic guests. Rallying his guard, he returned to find the revellers fused into an eidolon of screaming flesh, crowned by the mask’s cruel visage. The Palace Grandiose soon collapsed, and none know where its ruins lie.\n\nWhatever the truth of this grim fable, the Dreadful Visage is redolent with horror. It is an entity conjured from the Realm of Chaos whose lash-like tongues flail from its mouth. Those struck by these tongues are wracked by visions of the most atrocious acts imaginable.

His old potency returned, he has been ordained as a champion of Sigmar – but more than that, he is ally and advisor to the God-King.

These are then mounted atop the arcane constructs known as Mortis Engines, each guided into battle by a Corpsemaster learned in the ways of the amethyst arts. Carried upon a swirling hurricane of bound gheists that once served the great liche, a Mortis Engine acts as both a magnet of and a conductor for necromantic energies. The state of constant torment and horror in which the Engine’s spirits are trapped causes them to wail and screech constantly, a sound so terrible that mortals who hear it often perish from sheer terror.\n\nAs a Mortis Engine floats across the field, amethyst motes of magic are drawn to them as a ghastly miasma, ripe to be exploited by practitioners of Nagash’s arts. When threatened by advancing enemies, the Corpsemaster custodian can unleash this magic in a surge of unholy power that sweeps over regiments and sees their warriors simply crumble to dust. Those who survive face a fate just as brutal as the Mortis Engine crashes into them, its spectral guardians lashing out with blades and raking talons to deadly effect.",

With a talent for the finer points of wagering, bartering and – naturally – cheating, Skumdrekk has grown impossibly rich. Captives by the hundred are brought to the Murkvast Menagerie, and the roots of the mangrove trees are pulled aside to let specific beasts roam free. The details of who gets killed by what are the subject of an endless series of bets, with Skumdrekk and his Kountin’ Krew – a cadre of devious hobgrots backed up by troggoth muscle – presiding over the whole affair.\n\nSkumdrekk rides the elder beast Sloppklaw, a Sludgeraker he broke to his will as a yoof and his faithful steed to this day. Though extremely near-sighted and a bit senile, Sloppklaw is still the fiercest of his kind yet encountered, and he has a talent for sudden explosions of violence – any victim caught by Skumdrekk’s snatcha-stikk and dragged near the beast’s muzzle will be swiftly eviscerated.",

It is summoned by flinging two ensorcelled hammers into the troubled skies, where they revolve around one another, slowly at first, but gathering a deadly momentum. They multiply over and over as the vortex gets more intense to form a maelstrom; any caught in the vortex’s path are soon shattered into oblivion. The hammers are possessed of a furious sentience, seeking out agents of Chaos above all else to crush into paste.\n\nMany artificers and mages within Sigmar’s ranks believe the Celestian Vortexes to be imbued with the will of the Six Smiths, those legendary duardin demigods who played a vital role in the creation of the Stormcast Eternals. It is not unbelievable that the proud duardin demigods would wish to protect their handiwork – and the hammers that compose the Celestian Vortex reflect this desire by spinning into a vicious tornado that sweeps missile attacks clean away from Sigmar’s phalanxes.",

When the Ghyran sigil flares, Trugg’s powers of regeneration are sent into overdrive, allowing his wounded flesh to regrow in moments. When attuned to Aqshy, the Troggoth King is wreathed in flames to which he and his minions are impervious but that hungrily devour his foes. Trugg is too dimwitted to control the leystone’s powers beyond bashing it with his club, but his thick skull safeguards him from the worst effects of being in close proximity to such a potent source of magic.",

Even city ogors, known for their ability to overrule the grumbling of their stomachs for hours at a time, are unpredictable. No ogor likes being clambered over by a mere thinling who should really be inside their gut.

The most profound reward, however, is a chance for these ghouls to earn a weapon from their monarch’s private armoury.

Only the strongest wielders of necromantic power can command these undead drakes, and without their will, the beasts are swiftly rendered inert once more.\n\nThe darkness that animates a Zombie Dragon is never more evident than when it expels its breath, spewing it forth as a coiling cloud of withering death magic. This killing miasma shrivels flesh and corrodes the soul, instantly sapping the life from living beings. Husks are left in its wake where once there were soldiers. These desiccated statues are soon torn to pieces by the rampaging Zombie Dragon, while those fortunate enough to avoid its hellish exhalation flee in abject terror.",

The earliest examples were scavenged from the remains of a Ghyranite empire that hovered over the Scabrous Sprawl – these were the creations of the Sky- Titans, a race of gargants who made their home upon the metalith known as the Great Green Torc. Ogor legend has it that an ancient mawtribe climbed up to the Torc from the swampy lands below and declared war on the gargants they found there. The cannons of the Sky-Titans roared their wrath, their owners wading in with blade and fist, but in the end, it was not enough. One by one, they were toppled and devoured by those ancient ogors in a war above the clouds.\n\nThe ogors have found that loading Ironblasters with conventional cannonballs – by the dozen, if possible – yields impressive results, with pillars of flame shooting from each discharge as heavy metal shot thunders in a devastating column of destruction. The gunners who crew these outrageous weapons are usually deaf, and so they watch like a hawk for their moment to discharge their prized artillery. Any who decide to attack the cannon before it can be reloaded are charged in turn by a badtempered rhinox and a roaring, indignant ogor.",

However, after one kick too many from its master, the Arachnacauldron swallowed up Scrapskuttle himself. His exceptionally well-cooked remains still simmer within its mystical contents to this day, the shaman’s enchantment clearly having worked a little too well.",

They plummet from on high with bone-breaking force, smashing their prey to the ground and ripping them open with fangs and claws. Thrusting their muzzles into open wounds, they begin to devour their screaming victims alive. No amount of flesh or blood is ever enough to satisfy a Vargheist, however, and they soon begin the hunt anew, covered in the viscid crimson remains of their last meal.",

Owing to their looming vantage point, the riders usually either hunt with spring-jawed chaintraps, which they use to grab their prey and haul it up to be eaten; harpoon launchers the size of artillery pieces; or trained blood vultures that soar forth to peck at the eyes of the ogors’ foes. All Stonehorns are prized by the ogors – any creature that can barge through a duardin hold or shatter the bones of a Mega‑Gargant with a single charge has to be worthy of serious respect.",

The roaring of the blizzard then intensifies, surrounding the chanter with a swirling white aura. Creatures of the Everwinter lope to join them, a fell light glowing in their eyes. The wind drives the Huskard’s beasts on and lends them a fierce primal strength. Even the storm joins in the violence, head-sized chunks of ice raining down to hammer and pulverise those who earn the Huskard’s wrath.\n\nThe Thundertusk is a true force of destruction. Its enormous, jutting tusks, already formidable even before plates of spiked metal are bolted to their edges, are strong enough to batter apart a cogfort. The beast’s signature attack, however, is the spherical blast of ice it spits from its gullet, a boulder-sized projectile that can freeze enemy warriors solid in an instant. This is highly gratifying for the ogors; not only is each blast a decisive blow against the foe, but it also leaves their cadavers frozen and ready to be retrieved at leisure.",

Enemies that veer too close to this eerie wreck quickly find themselves assaulted by the predatory sea creatures that use it as their lair, the marine animals recognising the floundering presence of foes as a threat to their territory. The most skilled of Isharann mages will deliberately incite carnivorous fish to harass and distract enemies, lending a measure of cover to those Idoneth nearby so they may launch pinpoint attacks with impunity.",

Even if they are charging a spear-wall, they will still barge forward without hesitation; an ogor’s skin, fat, muscle and bone is so dense that most polearms will break in two rather than impale them.\n\nWhen Gluttons hit home, their foes are crushed bodily into the ranks of their fellows. The ogors capitalise on their crashing charge, staving in ribcages with their clubs and hacking clean through limbs with their oversized, rust-pitted blades.

These elegant serrated blades are light enough to allow the wielder to deliver a flurry of strikes before disengaging from combat and can harness the bioelectricity of the Fangmoras. The Ishlaen channel this force into their galv-shields, where it manifests as an energy field that turns aside enemy blows. Thanks to this protective aura, the Ishlaen are often assigned as the bodyguards of Akhelian Kings or other high-ranking Idoneth, directing their Fangmoras towards the closest advancing threats and laying them low with sweeps of their helsabres.",

More specifically, these gargants harbour considerable ill will towards the metropolises raised by Sigmar’s folk. The sight of a glorious city, with its proud spires and resolute walls, awakens a bitter fury within these creatures. With a bellow of hate, a Gatebreaker advances on an enemy settlement without fear, shrugging off panicked arrows and cannon fire with little more than a malicious chuckle.\n\nAs they approach, the Gatebreaker begins to swing their fortcrusha flail – a brutal weapon cobbled together from the wreckage of sundered cities – with terrible, mounting velocity. This flail can be used to hook onto the crenellations of a city’s battlements; with a flex of their immense muscles, the Gatebreaker uses this leverage to tear down an entire wall, laughing at the roar of collapsing stonework and the screams of defenders tumbling to their doom. Then the Mega-Gargant shoulders their way through the rubble and into the city, and the slaughter truly begins.",

Their Fangmora mounts are graceful and agile, able to twist along rocky seabeds and through gaps in an enemy spear-wall. Moreover, they are infamously bloodthirsty, tearing through prey with their bone-crunching fangs and delivering wicked whip-crack blows with their tails. Most impressive of all is their ability to generate an electric charge that can stun even large targets, leaving them ripe for devouring.\n\nArmed with voltspears and galv-shields, the Morrsarr Guard function as heavy shock cavalry, their fearsome weapons channelling the powerful electrical energy given off by the Fangmoras. This shockwave is loosed moments before the Morrsarr crash into the enemy, blasting the front ranks even as the Akhelians’ spears strike home. The Morrsarr are more than capable of engaging in extended melee, but their real strength is in that initial, overwhelming charge. Idoneth war stories tell of formations of Morrsarr Guard so large that the brightness of their combined voltaic blasts left the entire enemy army blinded and reeling.",

Though a Chaos Chariot is slow to accelerate, once it has begun to build pace, there is little that can stop it, and the driver’s cruel whip ensures that the Chaos Steeds maintain their speed. The charge of an entire squadron of chariots is like an avalanche of scythed metal, caving in shieldwalls and crushing the will to fight of entire armies.",

Some say that he was foolish enough to take a swipe at Kragnos, and the mighty blow to the skull he received in return filled his head with raging green fire. Others say that he was swallowed by a great stone idol of Gork, chewed up and spat out with god-given power.\n\nAnvilsmasha only makes an appearance when a Waaagh! swells to truly earth-shaking proportions. Striking his smith’s tools together until they glow bright with destructive energy, he sends this magic out across the orruks gathered nearby, whose weapons start to thrum with power. A choppa or basha so blessed by Anvilsmasha can lay low a Chaos Knight or knock a Draconith senseless, for when it hits home, it unleashes a thunderous blast of force.\n\nWaddling beside Zoggrok comes his constant companion, a rockbrow squig named Klonk. Born with a splitting headache that causes it constant pain, its suffering can only be temporarily relieved by a repeated bludgeoning of the head – making it the perfect tool on which Anvilsmasha can practise his craft.",

The Drakespawn were created in an attempt to recreate the Nakarth mounts of old, but they lack the raw power and flight of their draconic predecessors. The aelves believe that, on some level, the Drakespawn must know that they are incomplete creatures, for they are bitter-natured indeed.

Across their roiling flesh sprout grimacing, mocking faces and gnashing mouths that constantly squeal in a dreadful cacophony. Flamers do not possess legs; instead, they have a strange skirt of frilled flesh that undulates and inflates, drawing in both hot air and motes of aether before expelling them to propel the daemons forwards with ungainly haste.\n\nSo eldritch are the Flamers that they possess little active malice, but this makes them no less dangerous. A Flamer’s arms can be swung with bone-cracking force, but worse are the streams of warping flame they exude. Any being, be they mortal or immortal, caught in these clouds of raw Chaos energy is doomed to be wracked by the energies of change. All manner of horrific mutations overcome them, their form twisting and twisting again as the Flamers continue their inane gibbering. There are even accounts of some unfortunates travelling backwards in time or collapsing into a swarm of homunculus-esque doppelgängers that screech in pain before burning to a crisp.",

Similarly, those who follow the Beast-smashers are soon filled with pounding Waaagh! energy and seem more oblivious than ever to the blades and arrows of terrified pipsqueaks. Despite this propensity towards imitation, every Mancrusher dreams of one day growing to become a Mega-Gargant and forging their own path.

Resonant with the fierce exultation that the deceased experienced in their final moments, this holy liquid is refined and blended through a sorcerous process known only to the High Priestesses. The resulting broth has the viscous consistency of clotting blood, and a single draught heightens the senses to supernatural levels, imbuing the drinker with an uncontrollable bloodlust and robbing them of any sense of self preservation. Khainites under the influence of witchbrew will ignore even the most horrific wounds as they carve their foes apart.

Their knowledge is far from purely theoretical, as any who have seen them swinging their skalfhammers will attest – powered by their backpack-mounted generators, these weapons can crack a ship’s hull with ease. Should the Admiral thrive by balancing the right amount of daring with enough hard won wisdom, they will accrue more and more shares.

Their passion for battle, however, translates to a frightening degree of comprehension. While raw strength is usually enough to win the day, they have a basic but uncanny understanding of tactics, recognising when to fight, when to pull back and when to redouble their efforts. Should they be fired on by archers, the Warstomper will raise one arm as a shield to protect their vital organs. If they are charged by cavalry, the gargants will shake the earth with heavy jumps, breaking the momentum of the mounted unit.

Like phosphorescent algae, the glittering essences within the soul-reef will coalesce, taking the appearance of a mighty aelven god of the sea, with weapon in hand and a cloak of icy seawater cascading from its regal armour. Vicious aquatic life gathers around this avatar to attack any that draw near.\n\nIn the aspect of the sea, an Eidolon of Mathlann is more controlled, yet its becalmed demeanour in no way suggests it possesses a lesser degree of power. With a sweep of its deep-sea sceptre, an Eidolon in this form can release golden energies into the currents of the ethersea to rejuvenate the Idoneth’s wounded. However, the Eidolon can also turn its power to far deadlier purposes. With but a gesture, it can cause nearby foes to feel the horror of the endless sea. Suddenly, these unfortunate souls know what it is to be cast adrift with nothing beneath them but leagues of cold, dark water. This renders them paralysed in the throes of what they believe is their own death whilst the Idoneth move in to make this illusion a reality.",

Yet unlike the greenskins and ogors, the Goroans valued civilisation; they studied metallurgy and masonry, developed crude philosophy and raised a proud city known as High Progrexia. When orruks ransacked their home, the Goroans were overcome with rage, fighting a doomed war against the clans of the wild. It was Archaon who promised the Goroans vengeance if they would serve. They became shock troops in his armies and marshals of his warpits, no longer able to deny the bestial rage within them. It was this animal fury that drew comparisons with ogorkind and saw the term ‘ogroid’ rise to prominence.\n\nMyrmidons are amongst the most formidable ogroids, the most skilled champions of their arenas. Having retained their people’s stubborn pride, they now strive to test themselves against opponents of an especially monstrous heft. With their honed skills, innate battle rage and ancestral weapons, the Myrmidons are far from outclassed in these titanic clashes. Should they truly be pushed, the runic tattoos inked across their flesh will ignite with power – driving a Myrmidon to even greater pitches of fury.",

Many of the skills they have mastered out in the wilds can be turned against two-legged foes.

They do this not through learning and guile but by consuming quantities of toxic fungi that would kill humans thrice over and then jabbering incessantly about the resulting visions they experience. \n\nCave-Shamans fuel their magic with the Deffcap, a highly hallucinogenic mushroom that grows inside the shaman until it bursts out of their cranium. Cave-Shamans sporting such a fungus are capable of casting far more potent spells, for the mushroom appears to draw power from the Bad Moon itself.\n\nAny who seek an audience with a Cave-Shaman must tolerate the various squiggly beasts and other critters that nestle within their robes or writhe upon the grot’s gnarled flesh, such as the vicious Spore Squig, a common companion.",

He has honed his fighting skills to perfection during centuries of unlife, and countless warriors – both living and dead – have fallen to the one they call the Saint of Slaughter. Yet Vhordrai is prisoner as much as conqueror. Once before, the vampire lord sought to destroy Nagash and usurp his power. For his hubris, he was confined forever to the eldritch fortress known as the Crimson Keep and cursed to suffer an excruciating demise were he to leave its confines for more than a night.\n\nHalf-mad after countless years of torture at the hands of a vengeful Nagash, Vhordrai takes out his fury on the living. The Crimson Keep follows a deranged passage across the realms, manifesting in the ruins of shattered citadels and age-old strongholds. Wherever it appears, bloodshed and horror soon follow. Vhordrai emerges upon Shordemaire, accompanied by retinues of loyal Kastelai warrior-vampires eager for gory battle. For one night, the captive Prince indulges his appetite for monstrous cruelty, driving his lance through hearts and lungs and leaving behind a battlefield draped with blood-drained corpses.",

The lightest contact from such a blow can transform the victim into an unmoving crystal statue that is still horrifically conscious. The brood nests of the Melusai are lined with these living monuments. As sensualists, the Blood Sisters consider an eternity of sensory deprivation the worst of all possible fates, hence their delight in inflicting it upon others.

This often comes as a terminal shock to enemies who had believed that they had passed through the inferno intact, only to be suddenly overcome and burnt to death by fire-spirits that were waiting for the moment they deemed most cruelly entertaining. Other fire-conjuring daemons are inexorably drawn to Exalted Flamers, revelling in the grand blazes that these aberrations can unleash. Arcane blazes rage far more intensely in their presence, seeming only to grow in strength the more desperately a foe tries to smother them.",

So tall and strong are these beasts that they can wade through deep quagmires without slowing, making them ideal mounts for the marsh-traversing Breaka-bosses, who do not so much as get their feet wet before the beasts emerge dripping on the other side. These troggoths also endure the perils of battle well due to their disconnect with physical pain. When a Mirebrute is wounded, it will lash out in a violent frenzy at whatever is directly in front of it. This is especially true if the beast is blinkered; it literally sees only the foes standing before it. The Breaka-bosses find the ability to jab their steeds and make the enemy pay the price endlessly entertaining – and that price is typically being hammered flat by the massive clubs the beast is armed with.",

    "lore": "The daemon known as the Changeling is Tzeentch’s prime agent of misrule. None but the Lord of Flux has ever laid eyes upon this shapeshifting trickster’s true face, for it has assumed countless identities and guises over the centuries. Amongst its greatest coups was thieving seven of Nurgle’s sacred tomes from their place beside the Plague God’s cauldron, bringing Tzeentch many of his rival’s secrets. Arguably the Changeling’s grandest deception, though, was creating the persona of Valius Maliti, the master architect who designed many of the first Cities of Sigmar. In these bastions of Order, therefore, lie subtle flaws, ready for exploitation by Tzeentch’s legions.\n\nThe Changeling considers engaging in battle to be a personal failure, for spreading discord from the shadows is far more satisfying. Even so, there is a certain thrill to be found in impersonating officers and trusted companions, misinterpreting or mislaying orders so that an enemy force finds itself suddenly vulnerable amidst the carnage of war. Should the Changeling’s disguise somehow be seen through, this is no great concern to the daemon; the eldritch fires it summons and the form-shifting powers of its Trickster’s Staff can overcome most potential impediments.",

He is indisputably the ’ardest of all the Ironjawz, and his conquests are so extensive even he can’t remember them all.\n\nThe course of Gordrakk’s trajectory across the Mortal Realms has been meteoric. It was he who united the tribes of Ghur to smash back the conquests of Chaos, he who pummelled the fiercest living Maw-krusha into subservience to take it as his steed, and he who led the Waaagh! that almost reduced Excelsis to rubble. His twin axes – Smasha, forever hungry for the necks of warrior kings, and Kunnin’, thirsting for the blood of sorcerers – have rarely been out of Gordrakk’s gnarled hands for long. With every cloven neck, he rebuilds his ascendancy, and already there are rumours that Kragnos, though undoubtedly the killiest of the two, has the brawn but not the brain, whereas Gordrakk has enough of both to truly change the realms.",

Regardless, after the ritual, Bloodwrack Medusae become the goddess’s most faithful and loyal servants. Naturally resonant with arcane power, they eagerly absorb every scrap of magical knowledge that she grants them, including all manner of malicious spells and curses.",

The waters of the Mortal Realms are thick with hazards, from flesh-eating seaweed to spine-flinging gyresharks that can bite a vessel clean in half. Rather than fight a thankless war against these beasts, the masters of the Scourge fleets learn to avoid or even harness them using a combination of enchantment, patience and aelven artifice.\n\nThe Fleetmasters are known not only for the speed of their assaults but also for their flair. As happy to inveigle themselves into high society as they are to stoop to the gutter, they cut quite a dash in their frill-collared drakeskin cloaks. Any would-be rivals who underestimate them are soon corrected by force; the dexterity with which Fleetmasters wield the blade is quite incredible. Though nominally a part of the God-King’s great alliance, all such lords crave power unto themselves. Many a Fleetmaster sitting upon the Grand Conclave of a fortress-city has friends in low places, a commanding interest in the local narcotics market or a lucrative sideline in smuggling prohibited goods.",

It was the carcasses of these beasts that were raised through necromancy and bound to the will of the abhorrant monarchs as Royal Terrorgheists. Filled with a vampiric thirst equal to that of their masters, they soar over the throng of combat, their otherworldly senses seeking foes to slay. Their teeth and claws are the length of Sigmarite greatswords and are capable of cleaving through armour with ease, but these monstrous creatures possess an even more fearsome weapon in their arsenal: their infamous killing shriek.\n\nThe beast’s scream is as unmistakable as it is devastating. The high-pitched wail cuts across the battlefield, shattering the minds of nearby foes.

Its enormous, jutting tusks, already formidable even before plates of spiked metal are bolted to their edges, are strong enough to batter apart a cogfort. The beast’s signature attack, however, is the spherical blast of ice it spits from its gullet, a boulder-sized projectile that can freeze enemy warriors solid in an instant. This is highly gratifying for the ogors; not only is each blast a decisive blow against the foe, but it also leaves their cadavers frozen and ready to be retrieved at leisure.",

These daemons care not for the consequences facing those they torment; instead, they watch their suffering with enraptured fascination. Yet Lords of Change are manipulative to the point of compulsiveness, always adding new dimensions to their schemes even if it compromises their original aims.

These leaders employ effectively limitless military authority, able to veto invasions or legitimise the mustering of hundreds of warriors. The Lord Regents do not occupy any formal seat of power in a Great Nation’s rulership; they serve instead as Tyrion’s proxies, commanding those fronts where the Lord Phoenix cannot.\n\nRegardless of the nation they were born in, Lord Regents follow the Decree Tyrionic, moulded by traditions that prize decisive action over drawn-out cerebral contemplation. Each Regent spends countless hours studying matters of strategy, allowing them to make quick calls during battle, and they are adept at channelling solar energies into their warriors’ sunmetal blades until they blaze with captured light. The trials by which a Regent earns their rank are taxing in the extreme. Tracking down and earn the allegiance of a lightcourser, a swift-footed quadruped energised by Hysh’s radiance, is but one of these. As their mount sprints forward at blistering speed to deliver bone-breaking kicks, the Lord Regent draws upon the aetherquartz crystals worked into their wargear to launch precise attacks.",

Even more unnatural than a Beast of Nurgle’s appearance, however, is the joy that pervades these daemons. They are extremely, idiotically affectionate, always on the lookout for new playmates. Such is their enthusiasm that they cannot distinguish a mortal’s cries of pain as they dissolve from whoops of excitement.\n\nBeasts of Nurgle are one of the few breeds of daemon who truly lack any form of malice. This, however, does not diminish their lethal potential. Though they are far too excitable to follow orders or hold positions, the masters of the Plague Legions can always rely on the Beasts’ witless enthusiasm to create carnage. Beasts of Nurgle have little in the way of attention span, and become disappointed when the target of their affection becomes all still and boring – yet this is quickly rectified whenever the daemon spies another potential friend in the distance.",

When they find their quarry, their malice reaches a fever pitch. If the spurner is lucky, they will merely be ripped apart or impaled upon slime-dripping stingers.

However, such is the sanctum’s strength that a mage is ill-advised to summon it when surrounded by allies.

They find just as much satisfaction in watching the sun rise while seated atop their favourite rock as they do in destroying a village, and they crave the relief that only the sea can provide on their old and aching bones – as well as the bounty that washes up on its shores. Though extremely acquisitive, most Kraken-eaters will not make any effort to use their prizes, other than carrying them around in huge nets or haphazard bandoliers. However, there are those who propose a wild notion: not everything made by pipsqueaks is worthless. These Kraken-eaters attempt to actually understand the contents of their hoards, and the cleverest have deduced that magic is a powerful force. While the manipulation of arcane energies is a bit too finicky for gargants, an artefact that does it for them is another matter, so they collect any mystical doodads they can.\n\nDespite their hermetic existence, Kraken-eaters are still gargants at heart. The need to destroy and stake their territory is strong, as is their newly acquired desire to pillage treasure. Dark legends tell of them submerging their massive forms below the sea then snatching ships from the water’s surface in order to drown or eat everyone aboard.",

The newly created Fanatic is then dosed with temporarily immobilising concoctions, so they may be carried into the fray without harming their peers, before being let loose, forcing enemies and allies alike to dive for cover.\n\nGripping heavy chains ending in huge iron balls that would normally take several grots to lift, Loonsmasha Fanatics revolve with escalating swiftness, transforming into cyclones of death. The life of a Fanatic is measured in minutes at best, but what glorious minutes they are. In the brief time before they inevitably bash in their own skulls, crash into a wall, sail off a cliff cackling insanely or careen back into their screaming mates, they are – in their own fungus-addled minds, at least – gods of annihilation.",

Each is inducted into the ranks for their merciless nature and their ability to kill quickly and without hesitation. These aelves are also absolutely loyal to their Sorceress, surging ahead of her on the battlefield to obliterate the foe at a single, wordless gesture. Their fanatical loyalty burns with a passion so intense that it appears unnatural, and rumours swirl as to the amount of free will they really possess.\n\nWielding their gleaming swords with supernatural grace, the Bleakswords slice their foes to ribbons with a cruel laugh and a flurry of quick strikes. Their duelling speed is as deadly as it is famed – stories circulating around Dawnbringer campfires claim they make their moves in the blink of an eye. The Lordlings leading the Bleakswords are often the fastest and most precise of their number, able to thrust their sabre so quickly that they can slit a human’s throat before the foe can even draw their blade from its scabbard. The scant few hits they fail to deflect with their shields are swiftly riposted, knocking back enemies and leaving them vulnerable to the perfect killing counter-strike.",

After years of training with Galen, her father and mentor, the pair fight as a well-oiled machine. Doralia lays waste to spellcasting daemons from a great distance with her anti-thaumic crossbow, allowing her father to close in with a swing of his runic broadsword. Galen and Doralia worked together during the Siege of Excelsis to banish Synessa and Dexcessa, the twin daemons of Slaanesh – a feat that did not go unnoticed. As a result of her exploits, Doralia has earned the favour of the Seraphon, though the enigmatic saurians do not extend Galen the same recognition, much to her father’s frustration.",

Yet in private, this mask begins to slip, and the Lord Regent Supreme’s grief wells to the surface.\n\nIn the early decades of the Age of Sigmar, Lyrior was commanded to lead the defence of Tor Limina. Yet in doing so, he was forced to leave his home city woefully vulnerable. Lyrior was to pay the price for his loyalty; upon returning, he found the city obliterated by greenskin raiders. When Uthralle discovered the brutalised remains of his beloved kin, something broke within him. Even now he screams into the void each night; only the spiritual ministrations of a trio of Cathallars keep his soul intact. Lyrior now funnels his torment into deeds, riding out to command almost every battle Ymetrica wages against the orruks in person and venting his hatred.",

Bludgeoning aside enemy defences, they lash out with filthy fingernails and crude improvised weapons, heedless of their losses. Any who fall to a zombie risk being infected by the necrotic energies clinging to them, rising again to assail their former friends and allies.\n\nAs the remains of the freshly dead, zombies are amongst the easiest forms of cadaver to raise. It is for this reason that they are by far the most commonly utilised chattel troops in Soulblight hosts, hurled at the enemy in vast numbers to bog them down while the vampire elite chooses a vulnerable target to strike. Yet Deadwalkers are not always summoned into being intentionally; there are tales of graveyards, plague pits and corpse-choked marshes so suffused with the aetheric energy of Shyish that they have developed a malign and primitive sentience, and now puppet hordes of zombies lumber across the wilds as extensions of their primitive will.",

Many times did King Kurdoss bid them stalk worthy foes in the night, slaying their targets in hails of crossbow bolts or hacking their heads off to place before his throne. But as Valentian was cursed, so were his favoured killers.\n\nThe Craventhrone Guard are potent sharpshooters, their projectiles agonisingly drawn from their own essence. Their bolts always seem to find their targets, manifesting in flashes of spectral energy to strike down unsuspecting enemies. This is often to the disadvantage of their master who, denied the chance to rule, takes satisfaction only from combat. Though they loathe him for dragging them into a nightmare, they are forced to obey Valentian in every other respect. Because of this, the Craventhrone Guard take a mocking satisfaction in striking down their targets mere seconds before the Craven King can crush them beneath his heavy mace.",

These great felines do not exude heat, and they can pursue prey for hours without exhaling so much as a single telltale puff of condensation. This, combined with their natural stealth and cunning, makes them excellent hunting companions for the ogors. They are capable of outpacing even an Ymetrican stallion over short distances, and they are strong enough to drag down a juvenile rhinox. Once they have sunk their claws in a meal-to-be, their distinctive, curving tusks finish the job, sinking into the prey’s jugular or other vulnerable spot.\n\nIcebrow Hunters often train one or more Frost Sabres, usually from birth, to aid them in their more challenging hunts. Some of the most ambitious ogors make use of entire prides of such creatures, using them to shepherd prey into the path of their tribe. Of course, training these animals to give up their kills is often the biggest challenge of handling them – more than one incautious ogor seeking a greater share of the meat has been ripped apart by these beasts once their hunger has been stoked.",

They will slit the throats of their own thralls in an instant if the need arises, allowing them to draw power from the sacrifice. They see engaging in melee as beneath them and thus take satisfaction in speaking words of pain that contort any who dare draw too close.",

There is no mercy in the Everqueen’s heart; she has entered the season of her War Aspect and now blooms with a passion only vengeance can curb.\n\nAlarielle’s sorceries are able to summon flurries of healing pollen, as well as to mature new groves of Sylvaneth. In her right hand she wields the Spear of Kurnoth, a relic said to contain the dwindled essence of her consort and huntergod. Her left limb has been replaced by the Talon of the Dwindling, a sickle-like wooden claw that drains opponents of vitality. \n\nOne of the Everqueen’s most powerful allies is her mount, a hulking Wardroth Beetle. This titan’s horns can topple even fortress walls. When Alarielle takes wing, her Wardroth is capable of transforming into a swarm of pulsing glowspites to follow her and reform once more.",

These vampires are tied by blood to their beloved Ushoran, and both his power and his madness flow thickly in their veins. As deranged as their dread master, Abhorrant Ghoul Kings see themselves as honourable lords in service to a benevolent liege, and they feel a patrician’s imperative to ensure that their loyal populace is well fed and happy. In reality, this means that they launch constant raids against the lands of the living, gorging themselves on fresh blood and meat while spreading madness and horror wherever they go.\n\nLike the noblest martial monarchs, many Ghoul Kings choose to fight at the vanguard of their army. Delusions of chivalric glory swirl in their fevered minds as they seek out and challenge the mightiest foes to single combat. Needless to say, there is little that is honourable about the resulting bloodshed. Pouncing upon their prey with terrifying speed, the Ghoul King will proceed to eat the luckless victim alive, ripping and tearing with filth-encrusted talons as their fangs sink deep into their prey’s flesh, drawing up great draughts of warm, vitalising ichor.",

Each is armed with a spear of changemetal, a protean substance that can be fashioned only by those gifted in the sorceries of change, which flickers and morphs to better slip through enemy defences. Yet these tangible boons are secondary to the creatures’ strangest ability: through mere proximity, they can glean echoes of past events, hidden truths and suppressed secrets. Even hardened warriors cannot help but flinch as their most buried insecurities are suddenly laid bare – giving the Enlightened ample opportunity to run them through.\n\nThe most favoured Enlightened are granted daemonic conveyances known as Discs of Tzeentch to carry them into battle. They flock around the Shamans of their kind, forming a screeching honour guard. When their arcane master demands that some critical nexus of magic be seized, it is their Enlightened who see it done. Approaching the target at terrible speed, they shriek out the secrets of entrenched enemies, cackling in delight as confusion and horror reigns. It is then that the Enlightened dive into the melee, letting their spears and the spinning blades of their Discs facilitate the crude but satisfying business of slaughter.",

Doomfire Warlocks are at least given a measure of false autonomy, allowing them to ride to battle and wield dark arcane power. However, their dhaimkhyr – the sacred rune that grants Warlocks their magic – keeps them bound to Morathi’s will, and she will also use this connection to siphon off portions of their soul to keep them withered and subservient.",

These allow each Berzerker to channel the fury of Grimnir himself, augmenting a duardin’s physical prowess and resolve. When the latent power within these runes is fuelled by the rites of the Zharrgrim priests, the bearer’s martial skill reaches near supernatural levels.\n\nMany Vulkite Berzerkers wield weapons in each hand, the better to overwhelm their foes with a flurry of attacks.

Of course, at that point, the Big Boss joins in the fun, swept up by the sheer thrill of violence. Usually armed with a boss-hacka for enthusiastic pointing and stabbing, as well as a jagged choppa for close-quarters work, Big Bosses remind their boyz why they are in charge with every act of bone‑shattering brutality.",

As he gulped it down, he felt its white-hot flames course through him and unleashed a great belch of molten fire. The Firebellies insist that this event birthed the lava rivers of Aqshy or, indeed, the Realm of Fire itself. Most ogors have brains enough not to argue with them for long, as being turned into a smouldering pile of ashes is bad for one’s health.\n\nA Firebelly makes it their business to eat the spiciest and most flammable of foodstuffs to kindle their volatile gut in order to channel the Sun-eater’s fury. They will walk through fire and devour molten slop to such an end, pushing through the resulting pain. In war, Firebellies are able to breathe great plumes of flame and manifest mantles of burning magic that scorch the flesh from foes.

Each of these creatures weighs a ton or more, and they become even heavier when the orruks armour them in their signature slabs of iron plate. When a grunta gets the scent of blood in its snout, it will go into a ravenous frenzy – and much the same can be said about its rider. There is a lot in common between the two, including a thuggish temperament, a hunger for meat and even jutting tusks perfect for mauling the foe.\n\nThe Gore-gruntas, as the riders of these beasts call themselves, break battlelines by simply crashing into them at full speed. Enemies that somehow survive the horrendous impact are usually hacked down or decapitated by the bellowing orruk riders as they lay about themselves with their weighty choppas and hackas. Some Megabosses have come up with ‘taktikz’ for these assaults, such as the flank-crushing ‘Hoof Puncher’ or the twofold assault known as the ‘Tusks of Gork’. Regardless of their exact approach, all of these methods involve assembling Gore‑gruntas into a big stampede and sending them straight at the enemy’s lines.",

Those fortunate enough to be offered a draught of the cauldron’s brew find themselves plunged into an ecstasy of violence, their martial prowess magnified by the Lord of Murder.\n\nBrought to life by blood rituals, the iron statue of Khaine upon the shrine roars its anger in torrents of molten metal blood or swings its massive sword to hack down those who dare close with the cauldron.",

This enormous serpent is formed from boiling blood and contains a sliver of Morathi’s arcane might, and it is animated by a deeply rooted shard of her malice.\n\nThe Bloodwrack Viper is a magical manifestation of hatred and bitterness. With but a whispered word from its summoner, it will go on a ferocious rampage, killing all in its path. It binds its prey in a crushing embrace, burning mortal skin away with the heat of its ichorous body before squeezing so forcefully that the victim explodes in a shower of gore. Should an enemy be too large to simply splatter open, the serpent curls around them and tightens its coils, holding its prey in place and choking them in torrents of sticky black blood. With its victim immobilised, it will then strike with its monstrous fangs.",

When they pounce, jaws flashing with mouldering teeth, they are easily capable of ripping out a Gryph-charger’s throat or bearing an armoured warrior to the ground. Relentless and incapable of tiring, they are the perfect hunting hounds for vampires who seek to run their living prey to ground.\n\nPlentiful folklore surrounds these beasts, the most enduring example of which is their supposed ability to scent mortal terror upon the wind. There may be some truth to this, for a great many aristocratic vampires dote on Dire Wolves like favoured companions and grant them the honour of being the first loosed into battle; there, they viciously corral the petrified enemy, herding them into position for the Gravelord host to smash them asunder. In the wake of the resulting slaughter, there is always enough carrion to satiate the Dire Wolves’ hunger.",

Moreover, an ogor tribe generates a colossal amount of waste: weapons too small to use, pieces of torn armour, and sometimes even treasure. There’s nothing a Gnoblar likes more than a bit of looting, as all too often the ogors pass over something of genuine worth in their haste to eat the flesh of the fallen.\n\nLong ago, after an era of war at the hands of the orruk warclans, the Gnoblars allied with the ogor race – as long as the Gnoblars did all their dirty work for them, the ogors promised not to eat them unless they were really hungry. It was a one-sided bargain, for the Gnoblars work tirelessly yet still get thrown around and stuffed in the cookpot. However, it has seen these little horrors thrive – they are now present in nearly every ogor mawtribe across the realms.",

With filth-dripping trident, they lay about the foe, leaving those few who survive the initial onslaught broken in body and mind.\n\nEven this, however, does not spread disease swiftly enough for the liking of a Lord of Afflictions.

An Incubatch is the product of appalling rituals. To fashion such an entity requires the champion to barter away much of what remains of their soul. Some might even say that the Lords of Affliction fight so furiously in order to drown out the feeling of hollowness that eats at them constantly – though venturing as much before the champion would soon end in disaster.",

One may liken them to quartermasters in some manner, apportioning soul-matter to their minions and keeping the rest for Nagash’s vaults – though they are permitted to siphon off a small degree for personal experimentation. A Soulmason possesses encyclopaedic knowledge of the spiritual reserves available to them and knows precisely how much to call upon to energise or repair damaged warriors. They are famous for their trance-like focus, able to split their blended consciousness and perform a dizzying array of calculations at once.\n\nWhile Soulmasons are adept at aggressive spellcraft, their true value lies in bolstering the spirits of fellow Ossiarchs. Through their soul alchemy, these Mortisans provide aetheric nourishment to the Bonereapers, heightening their ferocity and focus. Such complex forms of sorcery beyond any Necromancer, and the Soulmasons must retain total concentration when wielding them, otherwise the welling gheist-energies may burst free in a shrieking mass. To avoid having to distract themselves with combat, Soulmasons take to battle atop elaborate bipedal thrones, whose raking claws can keep foes at a safe distance.",

A Thaumaturge’s sorcerous ability is channelled through the head of their totemic staff – a tool hand-crafted by the ogroid themselves – and released in storms of multi-hued wyrdflame.\n\nThaumaturges are certainly cunning, as many Magisters who seek to manipulate them learn to their cost, but their battle-rage is never far from the surface. When pain strikes, Thaumaturges fly into a frenzy, discarding the subtle arts of magic in their need to crush and tear.

The Claws of Karanak venerate Khorne as the apex predator of reality and Flesh Hounds as his truest manifestations. They emulate these daemons by chasing down any who offend the War God with displays of cowardice. The Packmasters of the cult are said to be able to smell a craven from miles away, and they wear the hides of magically gifted foes as prized trophies.\n\nThough they will respond to a worthy lord, the Claws’ desire to hunt is overwhelming, seeing them range far ahead of the horde. The carnage they wreak is such that many champions permit them the honour of first blood. The greatest honour for any such cultist is to battle alongside a Flesh Hound – or else to slay such a daemon after beating them to their quarry. Those who achieve this latter feat are transformed into slavering daemonkin known as Hounds of Wrath, loping forward on all fours to tear foes apart with their bare hands.",

The youngest and most aggressive mega-spiders lead the charge, carrying howdahs filled with shrieking grot warriors. Arachnaroks care little for the sneaky plans and kunnin’ tricks of Spiderfang warleaders, instead prioritising their own desires. Given that to question these would be to go against the will of their gods, the grots must simply adapt on the fly. Usually, this involves raining hell down on the enemy wherever they may end up going with crude spears and envenomed arrows.",

Each Knight- Draconis is charged with carving out territory not only for Sigmar’s people but also for new generations of Draconith.

When not called upon, these warriors dwell in the cavernous lairs of their mounts, studying the ancient arts of the Draconith and training for war. Once their connection has deepened to absolute trust, each pair will work together to craft an aeonfire blade. To forge such a weapon requires a harrowing ritual derived from the lost civilisation of the drakes, which culminates in the Knight-Draconis holding the blade beneath their mount’s blazing breath. This leaves their sword arm a charred husk but infuses it with power. Igniting their weapon with wrathful flame, the Knight-Draconis lays about the foe in arcs of burning devastation.",

Others are more esoteric – placing a single relic atop a hill or locating the bones of a fallen saint. The Knight-Questor may never understand the task’s significance, but they will go to any lengths to see it done. In recent times, these figures have become inextricably linked to the Bleak Citadels of the Ruination chambers.

So strong is their commitment to fulfilling their quest that nothing is permitted to stand in their way – certainly not enemy warlords, many of whom have met their end beneath a Knight-Questor’s heavenly broadsword.",

As the Masque enacts the tales of Slaanesh’s glories, their face flickers to match the characters they embody; their stance changes too, sometimes wild and aggressive, other times so graceful that it is all but impossible to land a blow upon them.

Seven feet of rippling muscle, they possess a bite that can cleave through hardened metal and a tail that can shatter limbs with a single, sweeping blow. Their iron-hard scales negate the need for armour, save for the ceremonial plates inscribed with sigils of the Old Ones they wear about their flanks. In battle, they hurl themselves against their foes without hesitation – striking out with celestite weapons and sinking their fangs into exposed throats and bellies with the fervour of a hungry predator – until their hides are awash with gore.\n\nFor all their ferocity, Saurus Warriors are not beholden to their primal fury. Their bloody attacks mask a rigid cohesion imbued in them from the moment of their spawning. Each saurus cohort fights under the grizzled leadership of an Alpha, obeying their commands without question – even if that means sacrificing their own lives to achieve some greater purpose. Neither unthinking machines nor blood-crazed killers, Saurus Warriors are utterly dedicated to one, all-consuming purpose: the eradication of all who threaten the Old Ones’ designs.",

Loonbosses relish a fight, and weapons they wield are laden with so many spiteful enchantments that they can carve clean through steel plate. However, they never fight fair. Ducking and weaving around their enemies, they hurl mobs of cackling grots at them to wear them down before finishing them off with a slice to the throat or a blow between the shoulder blades. The best fights, after all, are the ones conducted from behind a green wall of underlings doing most of the dirty work.\n\nTo become a Loonboss, a grot must climb the rungs of power by any means. Consequently, many become masters of unorthodox and opportunistic tactics, from feigning injury to pelting their enemies with exploding mushrooms that release flesh-eating spores. Loonbosses are infamously self possessed and eager to lavish themselves with grandiose titles such as Grand Under Emperor or Great Grotlord of the ’Umie-skinnas, but for all their preening, their cunning makes them as dangerous as any orruk boss.",

The Goroans, as they know themselves, once fought in the armies of primal Gorkamorka. Unlike their orruk and ogor kin, however, the Goroans saw notions of trade, forgecraft and magical study as worthy goals and sought to craft an advanced civilisation. Alas, the Twin-Headed God’s more basal hordes took umbrage with this. They sacked the Goroan capital of High Progrexia and a bitter civil war followed, one that saw the Goroans defeated and fleeing to the Eightpoints. They forged an alliance with the Everchosen, grudgingly embracing Chaos in the name of revenge.\n\nFor all their monstrous appearance, ogroids continue to exalt their former culture, corrupted as it now may be by Chaos. Their Theridon cohorts wield the traditional weapons of their people, tools that – along with the ogroids’ natural strength – can part even plate of meteoric iron. Yet bitterness has seized these creatures, constantly stoking their innate fury. On the battlefield, ogroids can fly into a berserk rage, tearing and maiming in truly gruesome displays that put the lie to any claim of true civilisation they might make.",

Their own shields are a literal extension of their skeletal frames, used to drive the enemy back and clear space for the disembowelling slash of a dread halberd.\n\nThough they do not get to choose whom they protect, the Immortis Guard go about their duty with the utmost dedication. It is claimed that they have never routed, and Katakros himself rarely takes to the field without a contingent at his side. More so than any other class of Ossiarchs, the Immortis Guard view their cohorts as single entities and each warrior as merely an element of the whole. They speak in an eerie, emotionless unity and coordinate their defences through a faint telepathic bond. It is said that the only time an Immortis Guard experiences a flicker of sentiment is when one of their brethren is irrevocably felled in the line of duty. Any dismay, however, is soon buried beneath the imperative to unleash a punishing counter-attack.",

From their number rose a champion so powerful that he ascended to godhood: Kragnos, the End of Empires. Having led his people in warfare against a draconic empire that left the Drogrukh all but extinct, Kragnos was sealed away for the protection of the realms – only to be freed centuries later. Though he currently wages a protracted war in the Realm of Life, Kragnos can still be drawn to battle by the most ferocious fighting, his arrival announced by the smashing of enemy lines and the crushing of foes under his thunderous hooves.\n\nAlready a natural disaster made manifest, Kragnos’s rampages are further augmented by his legendary armaments. The shield Tuskbreaker is said to have been cast aside by Gorkamorka himself, deity of the orruks and other brutish beings. The spells of enemy mages break instantly upon its surface, supposedly due to the residual divine essence that suffuses it. The Dread Mace, Kragnos’s massive studded club, is powerful enough to shatter walls of solid rock. Legends say that Kragnos retrieved the weapon’s head from an ancient geomantic nexus, and that it is infused with Ghur’s own destructive animus.",

Always do they seek new prey, their powerful wings carrying them to another part of the battlefield in moments, javelins materialising out of the mists into their hands. Should a tempting enough target present itself, the Heartrenders will forego their missile assault and dive straight into combat – their spiked shortspears are perfectly weighted for hand-to-hand fighting, and they can swiftly retreat should the enemy bring overpowering numbers.\n\nHeartrenders conceal their faces behind gilded masks, never revealing their true appearance even to their fellow Khainites. Some say that their faces are horrifically deformed and avian, possessing none of the statuesque beauty that the aelves prize. Perhaps this might account for their bloodthirsty nature and the cruel delight with which they pursue and slaughter retreating foes.",

This proves most useful on those occasions that the Isharann take to the battlefield, for a Soulscryer can always identify those souls most worthy of reaping. Soulscryers also work their strange magics to navigate the utter darkness of the deep places. Their eldritch senses allow them to guide other Idoneth along hidden paths in the realms’ oceans and rivers so that they can strike the foe from unexpected angles.\n\nThough they are not natural combatants, Soulscryers are more than capable of defending themselves.

The Gutrippaz add to this unsettling image by banging their weapons together loudly, howling like rabid beasts or bawling crude raiding songs. Gutrippaz, by nature, prefer it when a fight begins in their favour, but their blood runs as hot as any orruk’s, and when a scrap is properly underway, the biggest difficulty for a Killaboss looking to take prisoners can be getting the Gutrippaz to stop.",

Their affinity with the land also makes them excellent scouts; they often serve to secure sacred sites before the Sylvaneth’s enemies – or ostensible allies – can reach them.\n\nThose Kurnothi that favour the scythe attack with great, graceful sweeps of their blade, capable of bisecting any enemies of the forest that attempt to pass them by. Striding forward with calm and implacable purpose, they carve furrows through the enemy ranks, sending heads and limbs flying like scattered leaves. These steadfast hunters sprout thick weaves of thorny branches that pin their foes in place, tearing limbs from their bodies should they try to move.",

Eyes sprout across the pages, beholding the caster as intently as the wizard studies the Tome in turn. Even briefly consulting the Tome unlocks new paradigms of arcane practice, with spells once far beyond the caster’s ability becoming simple. New runes of insight appear even as the reader’s eyes reach them. None can say who composes these scribblings – perhaps one of the daemon scribes of Tzeentch’s court or even a fragmented aspect of the god himself.\n\nYet no gift of Chaos is given freely. The runes within the Tome of Eyes are elements of a terrible hex, one that takes full form as a reader plunges recklessly through its pages. The end result of the Parchment Curse is always the same: the victim transforms into scattered sheaves of paper, each detailing a twisted version of their life story. A talented mage may be able to transfer the accumulating energies of the curse from their mind into an unwilling target. Yet eventually the hunger for knowledge resurfaces, and the Tome awaits…",

Clad in baroque armour marked with leering daemon faces, they blend seamlessly into Archaon’s vast legions; beneath the surface, however, they are schismatics, upholding a secret religion known as the Dark Creed and worshipping Be’lakor as the rightful Everchosen. The Dark Creed claims that Archaon is a false king – a mortal granted power by the trinkets he carries but unworthy to bear the favour of the gods. Their patron, by contrast, was the first of the Daemon Princes, and the very skies have been cursed through his sinister will. It is a battle that must be undertaken in the shadows, for Archaon dominates vast swathes of the realms. Yet the Legionnaires share the patience of their Dark Master and are tireless in their efforts.\n\nCells of Chaos Legionnaires both serve in Be’lakor’s dedicated armies and fight amongst other Chaos hordes, whispering the tenets of their cult to any receptive ears. Their talent for subterfuge extends to confounding enemies as well, working to intercept orders or leave warriors suddenly isolated from their fellows. For Be’lakor’s legions, little is more satisfying than falling upon such vulnerable enemies and hacking them down with cruel blades and mauls.",

Despite this, ghouls believe themselves to be bringing salvation to the realms, and in the presence of the Flesh-eater nobility, their ‘valour’ reaches a manic intensity. Part of this ferocity is born from genuine devotion to the vampiric monarchy, but also responsible is the charnel stench of the abhorrants, which incites a frantic hunger in their underlings.\n\nAs lowly serfs, ghouls exist upon the edge of starvation. The scent of gore drives them wild with hunger, and when the odour mixes with that of their prey’s terror, the feeding frenzy that follows is horrific. Scrabbling across the earth on all fours, the Crypt Ghouls prove difficult targets to strike and close upon their prey with shocking swiftness. Though most are armed with nothing more than their claws and a few rancid bone clubs, ghouls attack in huge packs, bearing enemies down with their sheer weight of numbers and indulging their horrific cravings.",

Joining the Ironbreakers is the dream of many a young duardin warrior, and when these grizzled veterans visit the taverns of their clan holdings or a wider city, they have all manner of tales about what they have seen in the undercrofts of the realms. Even their wildest stories hold true, for an Ironbreaker’s word is itself nigh unbreakable. Nevertheless, few believe them – though perhaps this is for the best, given all that they have lived through.\n\nEach Ironbreaker marches to battle with a diamond-hard warhammer and gromril shield. Their commanders are known as Ironbeards, who take potshots at oncoming foes from behind the Ironbreakers’ shieldwall with smoking drakefire pistols.",

They shun contact with other beings, seeking the comforting foulness of their lairs in which to sleep away the centuries. As they snooze, some strange quirk of biology sees them grow or shrink to fit their dankhold; some troggoths doze off within preposterously cramped caverns and awaken half their original size, or else they wake up from a nap after twenty years to find they have become several times larger than when they went to sleep.\n\nShould Dankhold Troggoths be drawn up to a battlefield by the Bad Moon, they are a force to be reckoned with. They are able to regenerate even the greatest wounds with a slow but steady inevitability, and their diet of fungi that grow around realmstone grants them natural resistance to sorcery. In turn, the beasts’ huge clubs and fiendishly strong hands can batter the life out of anything.

They are capable of wrenching a human’s head from their shoulders with a single twist, and when they fall to all fours and pursue their prey, few creatures in all the realms can outrun them. Vargskyrs are also possessed of cunning befitting their predatory nature; they will stalk a victim patiently, sometimes for many hours, before falling upon them in a frenzy of slashing claws and tearing fangs.",

The urge to charge into battle and rend the forces of Chaos asunder is an ever-present call in the backs of their minds, and it is this desire that grants them such a kinship with the Stormcast Eternals. This is not to say that it is easy to earn a Dracoth’s respect; to do so, a warrior must pass the legendary Trials of Starwalking, the nature of which differs for each aspirant but remains forever perilous.\n\nMost who succeed become members of the Dracothian Guard, the heart of the Extremis chambers. They are amongst the most potent weapons in the Stormhosts’ arsenal, sent into the fray only when the need is greatest. The crossbow-armed Tempestors ride ahead into battle with their Fulminator kin, covering the charging lancers with a rain of missiles. Their Dracoths are quick of wit and action alike to exploit any weakness in the foe’s guard.",

In times past, they served the Archmage Teclis, guarding repositories of arcane artefacts and lore; ruins across the Realm of Light still possess feline statuary that harks back to this accord. Yet though the Sphiranxes were wise, Teclis forbade them from developing the understanding needed to use the magics they guarded, sparking a jealous bitterness within them. In a moment of weakness, they swore a pact with the Lord of Flux, being granted their third eye and telepathic abilities – but the flood of knowledge they glutted themselves upon soon drove them mad.

Once, these chariots were confined to the Gladitorium, where they were employed to train Stormcasts in the perils of the linebreaker assault. When Grungni the Great Maker returned to Sigmar’s Pantheon, his knowledge of mystical conduction helped adapt these carriages into tools fit for the battlefield.\n\nAs a Stormstrike Chariot builds up speed, it becomes surrounded by crackling storm energies. The faster it travels, the more potent this electric aura becomes, until eventually the energy is released, either through the missiles loosed by the chariot’s riders or by crashing into the enemy lines and discharging the force through blessed blades. The Gryph-chargers that pull Stormstrike Chariots are a breed originally native to the mountain passes of Azyr, though they have since been bred across the realms; these beasts show no fear when charging a line of presented steel, for their snapping beaks are often more than enough to see the task done.",

Many of these leather-winged titans were hunted to extinction or otherwise starved when the spread of civilisation robbed them of their favoured prey. They slunk away into dismal caves and echoing vaults to slowly die out, embittered and voracious. It was the carcasses of these beasts that early practitioners of necromancy discovered and raised as the abominations known as Terrorgheists. Their teeth and claws are the length of Sigmarite greatswords and are capable of cleaving through armour with ease, but these monstrous creatures possess an even more fearsome weapon in their arsenal: their infamous killing shriek.\n\nAs a Terrorgheist swoops down from the sky, it will unleash a piercing audial barrage, splitting the flesh and pulping the skulls of its victims through sheer sonic pressure. Survivors are left reeling and defenceless against the eternally starving beast as it attempts to devour them, and such is the size of its maw that human-sized prey is often swallowed whole. Yet as the Terrorgheist’s innards rotted away long ago, the savaged remains do nothing to satiate its cursed hunger, instead simply adding to trail of broken corpses it leave in its passing.",

When Mork’s Mighty Mushroom erupts onto the battlefield, it belches inescapable clouds of horrible motes that cause smaller Skullshrooms to violently burst forth from everything they touch – a process that has particularly messy results upon living things. Grots know to steer clear of even the smallest of these fungi, as simply brushing a finger against one can lead to a painful death.\n\nIn order to cultivate the requisite spores between their toes, Gloomspite mages will carefully harvest Skullshrooms and mix them into potions and tonics. They will then dose themselves with such draughts once a day, remaining in the darkest depths of their lurklairs. After a few weeks of hard sweating, avoiding bodies of water and tramping around in the mud, a good reserve of fungal crust will build up in the divots of their feet, thus beginning the cycle anew.",

They cut a fearsome sight as they order their screeching soldiery forward in a gushing tide of ectoplasm, spurring them on to take their vengeance against the living.

Immortalised in bardic songs as Bloodmothers, Red Spiders or Pale Doyennes, they adopt the persona of the courtly matchmaker to manipulate liaisons between nobles and produce the most sumptuous blends of blood within their progeny – all for the vampires to feast on, in due time.\n\nSome Sanguinarchs, however, maintain that only the pulse-pounding emotions of the battlefield can properly spice their creations. Riding atop stately Bloodseeker Palanquins carried by screeching gheists, these vampires hunt down champions whose blood they judge to be of particularly high quality before extracting it using gruesome exsanguinating sorceries. They excel in distilling the aetheric resonations of violent death into their concoctions of hero’s gore, and though even other vampires may consider the Sanguinarch’s obsession with crafting the perfect vintage indulgent, they cannot deny the power that infuses them as they sup upon the macabre artiste’s work.",

Having abandoned all sense of propriety, the Blissbarbs pierce their flesh in a deliberately painful fashion and wrap themselves in luxuriant silks. Their days are spent in mind-blasting revels, but when battle beckons, they take up their bows and dart forth to do Slaanesh’s work.\n\nBlissbarb Archers do not fight at range out of choice. Slaanesh’s champions have no desire for their close-quarters ‘entertainment’ to be disturbed by such lowly acolytes and instead bid the archers attack from afar. Still, the Blissbarb may partake in some of Slaanesh’s gifts. The shuffling Homonculi that follow them carry censers filled with blissbrew, a highly hallucinogenic substance. Not only do the fumes delight the Blissbarb, but by coating their arrow tips with the concoction, they also bring unravelling glee to their enemies. Foes who dutifully hold positions of tedious strategic import are the favoured prey of the Blissbarb, who hunger to drag these souls into their phantasmagoria.",

Prisoners will be sacrificed without pause to provide this sacred libation, but blood taken in honest battle is more pleasing to Khorne. The sacrificial daggers wielded by the Realmgore Ritualists are relics anointed in atrocity, and merely a single cut from such a weapon can see a foe rapidly and violently exsanguinated.",

There are nine of these dreaded sorcerers, and each is the lord of a Silver Tower – looming crystalline edifices that travel across time and space, disgorging hosts of daemons and Arcanites from their labyrinthine innards. Having been elevated to their station by Tzeentch himself, Gaunt Summoners are entrusted with schemes of immense complexity and import. They rule their Silver Towers as mad fiefdoms and delight in magically trapping rivals and adversaries within. These unfortunates are subjected to endless trials for the amusement of the Gaunt Summoners. Few ever escape; fewer still hold onto their sanity.\n\nOnce, the Gaunt Summoners were given freedom by Tzeentch to pursue the accumulation of magical power as they saw fit, but Archaon the Everchosen wished to possess the might of the Gaunt Summoners for his own. The Change God concluded that allowing Archaon to seemingly usurp dominion of the nine daemon sorcerers would better serve his own ends. So did the Everchosen win the true names of all the Gaunt Summoners, never realising the subtle aid from which he benefited. Ever since, the Gaunt Summoners have chafed beneath his rule, plotting to one day rebel and claim his throne.",

Horrors find cruel mirth in wielding these arcane projectiles against Tzeentch’s enemies, observing the unpredictable results with fascination.\n\nThough they are nonsensical beings, there is a crazed logic to the hierarchy of the Horrors. The largest are the Pink Horrors, the most jovial and arcanely talented of their infernal breed. Should a Pink Horror receive a telling wound, they will gasp dramatically before coming apart in a burst of ectoplasm. In its place are two smaller daemons known as Blue Horrors. These are more bitter and sullen but can unleash barrages of magic regardless. When a Blue Horror is slain, blazing imps known as Brimstone Horrors spring up. These diminutive daemons are the most vindictive breed of Horror. Lacking in higher thought and prone to burning themselves out rapidly, they swarm towards enemies with cackles of malice, intent on setting alight cloth and flesh.",

In battle, a Necropolis Stalker can bring one of these spirit fragments and their respective skills to the forefront of their consciousness, signified by their mask rotating until a new head faces forwards.

Rebellious and unpredictable, Ivya shows little reverence for the wolf – the traditional symbol of the Vyrkos – and instead surrounds herself with a needle-fanged swarm of bats. These creatures will sacrifice themselves without hesitation to protect their mistress, descending in a shrieking flock and sinking their teeth into eyes, throats and soft flesh.\n\nDespite her rejection of Vyrkos traditions, Ivya has grand plans to expand the reach of her dynasty and ultimately aims to found a haven of death from which they can launch invasions across the realms. Though still scorned by many of her peers, it may well be Ivya who leads her kin to a new promised land, and though she has little interest in fighting mere mortals, she will not hesitate to cleave her way through the defenders of a Sigmarite outpost so that the undead might claim the nexus point beneath.",

Wielding Alakanash, the Staff of Power, the cursed blade Zefet-nebtar, and surrounded by the Nine Books of Nagash, the Great Necromancer commands the full, terrible power of Shyishan magic.

Even the Mortarchs bend the knee at such decisive moments, knowing that to challenge the Lord of Undeath is to invite permanent annihilation – or a punishment far worse. As Nagash summons necrotic soul-storms and whirlwinds of death to lay low the living, his Soulblight armies sweep forth to strike the final blow, desperate to please their pitiless master.",

Those who would threaten this cosmic pattern are destined for destruction.\n\nWith a slow blink of their eyes or gentle wave of a hand, a Starmaster channels the fearsome potency of cosmic magic. Enemies are reduced to atoms by arcs of scintillating lighting, while the Starmaster’s own warriors are translocated through space and time to emerge wherever they can inflict the most damage. So supreme is a slann’s magical expertise that their skink attendants become vessels through which the Starmaster can project devastating conjurations, allowing their eldritch might to reach every corner of the battlefield.",

These nightmarish jesters are infected with the Chortling Murrain, one of the most insidious of all Nurgle’s concoctions. The Murrain sees infected mortals slowly be overcome by nagging hysterics and the compulsion to dance and make merry, until their sides literally split or their hearts burst from exuberance. Daemons cannot perish through exertion alone, but the Murrain seizes control of their minds all the same, until whatever individuality they possessed is lost under newfound exuberance.\n\nBilepipers caper with a wild energy, drooling and grinning all the while. Their revolting quips and nauseating – in every sense of the word – wordplay leaves most daemons in fits of hysterics and buoyed with ebullient fervour. The dour Plaguebearers, meanwhile, fight harder to drown out such grating jocularity. Yet if the Murrain should ever go into remission, the Bilepipers find their noxious wit vastly diminished and the chortles of their compatriots growing increasingly strained. Should the daemon receive no laughter at all, they will agonisingly transform into a marotter and set of gutpipes for another Bilepiper to inherit.",

In the Creed’s view, this is an act of utmost altruism; their teachings state that in decay and entropy lies the path to immortality. This search for eternal, unchanging life has consumed the Creed since its founding; its first members were forced to flee Sigmar’s cities into the swamps when their unnatural researches came to light.\n\nWarriors of the Rotmire Creed attack in a hail of darts coated and filled with diseased fluids. Their Witherlords distil such juices from the waters of the Rotmire; the bodies of those who perish here are dragged into vast, leaking corpse-idols by the cult’s Carrion Catchers. Living victims are often held captive amongst these midden heaps, their drawn-out suffering studied by the cult. The Creed’s elders remain obsessed with the search for immortality and have dispatched their cultists far and wide to seek out new ingredients for a foul elixir of life. Many of these warbands join with Maggotkin hosts, seeing in them true followers of Lord Leech’s will.",

Two shrineguards armed with long goadstaves strike out, while the writhing Medusa uses her weapons and deadly gaze to join the slaughter. As formidable as the shrine is in close combat, it has another, more sinister purpose. A strange mirror known as a scáthmre stands at the shrine’s centre, reflecting not just the Bloodwrack Medusa’s deadly gaze but also an agonising aura, a shadowy projection of the scathing hatred harboured by the monstrous serpentine creature.

In times of dire need, the lurelight’s magic can even channel this spirit-matter into the broken bodies of wounded Namarti, knitting together their injuries so that they might fight on.\n\nOnce back in their undersea strongholds, the souls will be transferred, with those of the Idoneth enshrined in the chorrileums and others made ready to be seeded within newborn Namarti. However, until they return to their enclave and deposit their priceless bounty, the Soulrenders must fight tooth and nail to protect it. They do so with a vicious polearm known as a talúnhook, snaring their enemies from afar and forcing them to their knees so that they might be more easily dispatched. To aid their hunting, each Soulrender employs a Rakerdart, a bond-beast that glides at its master’s feet, ready to stab prey with its sharp bill to ensure none can escape.",

Where these searing runes emerge, the aetheric power of light surges; nearby Lumineth are empowered, while rifts torn open to the Realm of Chaos may be sealed.\n\nThe Calligrave discipline was pioneered by Il’yentai of Syar. It was she who devised the means of binding arcane energy into parchment for later deployment, and it was she who developed the tools of their trade: mystical brushes and daethar stilt-shoes that prevent stored spells from being accidentally earthed through contact with the realms. Successive generations then built upon her efforts, refining their sigil-conjuring techniques to the level of true artistry. When summoning an arcane construct, a Calligrave ensures that the incantation will not fail, having studied its runes thoroughly and extensively.",

Even the undead can be afflicted by this magically augmented negativity; with their foes immobilised by a sudden self-awareness as to their cursed half-existence, a Lumineth host is able to cut them down without resistance.\n\nCathallars are lonesome figures who move as if in a detached trance. They keep their hands and feet bare at all times, allowing the negative psyche-magic that clings to them to dissipate into the earth. Cathallars rarely seek out the company of others, and fellow aelves are generally content with this – though they respect the burden these mages carry, few wish to confront their own darker aspects.",

Granting allies shields of magic, channelling energising spells through runes to share them with their compatriots or causing assailants to suffer a precise reflection of any harm they deal out are just some such magical weavings. Yet in the heart of every Enlightener is a hidden desire to manifest the full wrath of Hysh, and very occasionally, when they are within the blazing crucible of battle, they will do just that.

Foremost of these are the Solar Engines, particularly devastating artefacts said to be older than the Mortal Realms themselves. These glowing crystal mechanisms focus celestial energy into blinding beams that flash across the battlefield. Anything caught in their trajectory is bisected and incinerated in an instant. So fierce are the temperatures emitted by a Solar Engine that only the heat resistant scales of the Bastiladon can withstand them – and the device has the added benefit of keeping the beast pleasantly warm on more frigid battlefields.",

Others wield a hammer in each hand, eschewing defence in favour of carving a bloody path forwards. Each weapon is made of pure sigmarite drawn from the core of the World-that-Was.

This alpha Flesh Hound is unleashed when an enemy has earned Khorne’s personal displeasure. Each of Karanak’s heads tracks its quarry in a different fashion. The first senses across space, following the spoor of the target no matter where they hide. The second follows through time, seeing both those who try to hide in the recesses of history as well as those who will incite Khorne’s rage in the future. The third head is the most dangerous, for it tracks its prey from within their own mind.\n\nKaranak has little inclination to lead armies; his only goal is to drag his quarry back to the base of the Skull Throne, where they will be torn apart under Khorne’s glowering gaze. Even so, where he lopes, other warriors of Khorne follow – for Karanak’s hunts take him through the most furious of battles. Accompanied by packs of slavering Flesh Hounds compelled to join the pursuit, Karanak chases down his prey without remorse or relent, as indefatigable as a falling axe.",

There is no set period in which his crimson resurrection occurs. Sometimes the Slaughterborn vanishes for years after falling; sometimes he returns in mere moments. Yet, eventually, return he always does. Skarr’s psychotic fury is a beacon to fellow Bloodbound, who travel for leagues to fight alongside him. Wrathmongers in particular feel a kinship with Skarr, often acting as an impromptu retinue – though the Slaughterborn pays them less than no mind as he kills and kills again.",

Those who would slay this peculiar double creature at close quarters find themselves thwarted by the strong sword arm of the host, a formidable warrior in their own right.\n\nCurselings are thieves of the arcane, loathed by those gifted in spellcraft. Yet their existence is a fraught one. Tretchlets are conniving entities, forever scheming to seize control of their host. Should the Curseling not remain on guard, they may find themselves trapped within their own mind, forced to watch as the Tretchlet puppets them onwards.",

Yet Be’lakor is a creature of matchless cunning; even as he raged at his predicament, nursing hatred for the ‘False King’ Archaon, he schemed to reclaim his place at the forefront of the hordes of Chaos.\n\nBe’lakor prefers to work in the shadows, orchestrating manipulations over decades. Most infamous of his schemes was the genesis of the Cursed Skies, clouds of corruption that spill across the heavens and can even prevent the souls of slain Stormcasts from returning to Azyr. When the Dark Master takes to the field in person, he is a force to be reckoned with. Through sorcery and guileful whispers, he leaves ordered battlelines in milling disarray, or he engineers events to ensure they never arrive at all. Those few who stand firm are swiftly bisected, body and soul, by the Blade of Shadows. The terror of mortals is as the sweetest nectar to Be’lakor, who takes it as proof of his own supremacy.",

    "lore": "When the Wyldwoods of the Sylvaneth stir, enemies of the natural order must be on their guard. The forest spirits that reside in these ancient groves are roused to terrible fury by intrusions into their domain, and will seek every chance to prey upon those foolish enough to stray beneath their shadowed boughs – even more so when arcane powers are at work nearby.\n\nThe Sylvaneth are beloved of these wild and verdant copses. The Wyldwoods’ ancient sentience recognises the efforts of Alarielle’s children to protect and cultivate life in all its forms, and will allow them to travel between them using their jade magic-laden roots. They also serve to protect those Sylvaneth that dwell within their glades, as it is only possible for foes to see a few yards into these foreboding thickets. Those unlucky enough to wander into these dense and disorienting woods find themselves lost almost immediately, with the fey laughter of the concealed Sylvaneth echoing from all around.",

    "lore": "Few creatures are as revered by the skinks as the Spawn of Chotec. These firespewing salamanders are born under the aspect of the sun god himself and seen as manifestations of the divine flames that infuse the Seraphon with vigour. But the Spawn are not alone in their fiery blessings. When the stars pulse with flaring wrath, the spawning pools of the skinks steam and boil, and from within emerge the Sun Acolytes, marked out as Chotec’s favoured by their frills and fins. These are the Spawn’s handlers, tasked with guiding their charges into battle and weaponising their inner fire to incinerate the servants of ruin and destruction. When a Spawn of Chotec reaches maturity, the Sun Acolytes install fragments of technology belonging to the Old Ones in its cranium – relics that allow them to join their minds with the beast in times of war and direct its killing power. \n\nGuided by the ruby-tinted light emitted by its handlers’ staffs, the salamander belches gobbets of acid at the enemy. These liquids ignite upon impact, erupting in great fireballs that melt armour and flesh with ease, transforming the victim into a screaming, blazing torch. Should the enemy close in to deliver a killing blow, the Spawn of Chotec will emit streams of searing flame before lumbering forwards to devour the charred remains of its unfortunate prey.",

    "lore": "Magisters are amongst the most magically powerful of Tzeentch’s mortal servants. It is they who lurk at the heart of an Arcanite cult, manipulating all and sundry to ensure the Change God’s will is carried out. Though they prefer to operate from their sorcerous lairs, when Magisters take to the field, they revel in unleashing their most devastating evocations. With a gesture, these master sorcerers summon roaring flames of every colour or exude rays of pure changemagic that warp enemies beyond recognition. The more outlandish the fate they can inflict, the more honour they do to the Changer of the Ways.\n\nMagisters are privy to eldritch secrets that have twisted them into something unnatural. Their limbs grow long and backwards-jointed, while their faces mutate into leering masks or sprout with clusters of iridescent eyes. Yet for all their arcane might, Magisters are still mortals, and they risk body and soul each time they channel the unbound potential of change. Many are the tales of Magisters who drank from the font of their god’s power too eagerly and found themselves eventually overwhelmed by it, reduced to a mewling lump of flesh. But Tzeentch demands unlimited ambition from his Magisters, and the lure of ultimate sorcerous might is a prize they will go to any length to claim.",
