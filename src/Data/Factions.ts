They are mortalkind’s greatest fears made manifest: vengeful wraiths whose sole purpose is to drag the living into death’s cold embrace. Though their forms are as insubstantial as mist, their raking claws and rusted blades pass through metal and bone with but a whisper, stopping hearts and turning blood to ice. Unbound from physical laws, they can pursue prey through solid walls, drinking in the helpless dread of their victims in the moments before their deaths. Sword strikes and arrows cannot harm the Nighthaunt unless delivered with courage and conviction; those who give in to panic when confronted by these phantom horrors are already beyond hope.\n\nIt was the Great Necromancer Nagash who fashioned the Nighthaunt, crafting them from the tattered souls of those who committed some real or imagined transgression against him. Each is nightmarish in form, their appearance reflecting their past life and their sins against the laws of Nagash. A criminal who perished in the darkness of an oubliette might find themselves trapped forever in the terror of their final lightless moments, while a healer who sought to preserve life and thus denied Nagash his due might be transformed into a blade-limbed nightmare that can do nothing but slaughter, all the while aware of the cruel irony of their fate. The Nighthaunt know nothing of satisfaction, contentment or peace; indeed, their very existence is a curse. Only two things unite these hateful spectres: their bitter jealousy of the living and their desire to slay all who draw breath – so that their victims might join them in eternal, unbearable suffering.",

    "lore": "The realms are filled with hazards of every conceivable kind, but to the ogors, they are a glorious banquet that spreads from horizon to horizon. The thinling races look upon these ever-hungering brutes as monsters, yet ogors are more than ravenous beasts. There is a religious aspect to their feasting, and they believe that to glut themselves is to offer tribute to their Gulping God. Standing over Mawpots full of unholy slop, the gastromantic priests of their race empower their brethren by accentuating the flavour of everything tossed into the slurry within.\n\nUnlike gargants or troggoths, ogors can create as well as destroy. They make crude but effective weapons, their stout and clumsy fingers dexterous enough to rivet plates of metal to their clubs or fashion heavy cleavers that can hack a rhinox in two. The battered shields of their slain enemies are strapped to over-muscled limbs, and gut-plates the size of wagon wheels take pride of place on their bulging bellies. Even blackpowder weaponry is not beyond them, to which the fearful survivors of their cannonades can attest. Especially ravenous warglutts, as the ogors’ loose war ‘formations’ are known, will equip their finest warriors with such weapons – after all, it is easiest to blast their foes into ready-cooked chunks.\n\nConsuming everything in their path, ogors roam as a nomadic horde, their beasts of war thundering alongside them even as their snickering Gnoblar attendants are swept along for the ride. Those known as the Beastclaw Raiders travel in large packs upon their furred mounts, constantly on the move to avoid being frozen solid by the Everwinter, an eternal blizzard possessed of a bitter sentience. Across the realms, the law is the same – only the strong survive. The ogors have such strength in great measure, and to underestimate them is to be devoured.",

They are the Skaven: the Children of the Great Horned Rat, a race that combines the worst aspects of man and vermin. The average Skaven stands roughly as tall as a human, though their posture is typically stooped and furtive. They are swift and agile, powered by a heightened metabolism that devours them from within. This ‘Black Hunger’ dominates their thoughts. They consume constantly, aggressively and recklessly, tearing one another down to get ahead. In the aftermath of battle, the Skaven will swarm across the dead, gnawing them into scraps of bone.\n\nThe Skaven psyche centres around two conceits. Each ratman, from the lowliest thrall to the mightiest chieftain, is convinced that they are the greatest being ever to have lived. They are also certain that all of their underlings, peers and superiors are conspiring against them. This institutionalised paranoia might be crippling if it was not so rooted in fact. Natural cravens, Skaven quickly learn to wheedle into the good graces of their masters and thereby gain a chance to ‘remove’ them, while keeping watch for lessers with ambitions above their station.\n\nHaving long manipulated events from the shadows, the Hour of Ruin has seen the Skaven unleashed as never before. Hordes without number spill from unstable arcane portals known as gnawholes, determined to reduce reality into a wasteland. They have already done so to much of the eastern Great Parch, transforming it into the polluted wasteland known as the Gnaw. Each and every ratman is filled with a desire to cement their supremacy beyond doubt – and stick a knife into the back of any old rivals, if they can get away with it.",

He is the most abstract of the Chaos Gods, formless and protean even to his most favoured acolytes. Lurking at the centre of the Impossible Fortress, his fractal domain in the Realm of Chaos, he plucks at the strings of causality to further his maddening designs.\n\nTzeentch is empowered by hope, a notion that at first seems far from ruinous. When revolutionaries plan to overthrow an unjust regime, it is Tzeentch who manipulates events in their favour. When a mage desires greater control of magic to defend their people, it is Tzeentch who comes with bargains and boons. But mortal hopes have fixed end results in mind – and these are of little interest to the Change God. He would see rebellions last forever, ensuring no true stability can flourish. He would grant a desperate wizard so much power that it consumes them, transforming them into a mind-shattering abomination of the aether.\n\nTzeentch’s daemonic convocations are just as warped as their master. They are magic, lies and schemes given form, each utterly deranged and obsessed with the propagation of change at all costs. Even the least of Tzeentch’s daemons can conjure gouts of mutative magical flame; the greatest are able to twist flesh and snap psyches with the merest expression of will. Many mortals also worship Tzeentch, from avian mutants to sinister magi lurking in the bowels of Sigmar’s cities. Service to the Architect of Fate offers great rewards; many of his chosen are gifted in the esoteric arts or have influence over fate and perception. These Arcanites meet far from prying eyes, laying plans for the day they will rise up in a pyrotechnic storm of sorcery, all for the glory of Tzeentch almighty.",

Islands of civilisation in a sea of darkness, they must not only fight to survive but also send out militarised expeditions that will see new strongholds established across the lands.\n\nBrave men and women enlist together to march alongside duardin, aelves and even ogors on an endless quest to bring order back to the realms. There are never any shortages of volunteers, and in truth, each expedition is driven by the desire to better the lives of kith and kin more than it is for some lofty celestial goal. Theirs is not the might of the heavens‐wrought champion; their inner steel is not gifted from the gods or inherited from arcane bloodlines. Instead, these are simple folk, and they must find what strength they can, for the fate of the realms rests on their aching shoulders.\n\nWhen the Cities of Sigmar fight, they do so in tightly drilled regiments, shieldwalls abutting cannon emplacements and battlelines bracketed by Ogor Warhulks as a castle wall is reinforced by its towers. Thanks to the innovations of Tahlia Vedra, much beloved First Marshal of Hammerhal Aqsha, they move forward in her Castelite formation. This tactic transforms armies into living fortresses, drawn up at a barked order to optimise fields of fire and make best use of the surrounding terrain. Yet even when the foe is routed and the day won, there will be no rest.

In such frenzies of exultant slaughter, Khaine’s worshippers reach a dreadful closeness with their divine patron.\n\nTheir leader is Morathi, the self-proclaimed reincarnation of the Bloody-Handed God. This being of ancient cunning and terrible power has at last claimed godhood after millennia of bitter struggle – albeit at the cost of cleaving her physical and spiritual form in twain. She is now two entities joined by one soul: the guileful and manipulative Morathi-Khaine, the face and voice of the Khainite cult, and the serpentine destroyer known as the Shadow Queen. Even thus divided, Morathi’s control of the creed is ironclad, and with every passing day, she consolidates it further by disposing of any who would question her divine mandate, whether they speak such blasphemies openly or hide them in their hearts.\n\nDespite possessing large and resource-rich territories in the Realm of Shadows, the Daughters of Khaine and their ambitious goddess are not content to simply hold on to what they have; they aim to spread the influence of their warlike god to all corners of the realms.",

As they disembowel their prey and gobble down chunks of offal, they dedicate the feast to their beloved liege-lord Ushoran, the Mortarch of Delusion.\n\nUshoran is an elder vampire of huge and bestial aspect whose shattered psyche is trapped in an illusory world of his own conjuring. He believes himself a saintly sovereign overseeing an empire of noble-hearted paladins. In truth, he is the epicentre of a dreadful curse that has infiltrated every corner of the realms, giving rise to cannibal kingdoms that prey upon mortals at will. The Carrion King’s vampiric offspring – the abhorrants – rule over these vassal-states, lording over courts of underlings arranged in a grotesque mockery of chivalric hierarchy.\n\nThe thralls and yeoman footsoldiers of these vampiric rulers are the ghouls, hunched, wretched creatures who hover on the precipice between life and undeath. They were humans, once; driven by desperation, they fed upon the flesh of the dead and, in doing so, damned themselves. As their bodies atrophied, so did their minds, denying the abominable state of their existence. Many fell under the sway of the Carrion King, finding solace in the shared insanity of a Flesh-eater Court. Now Ushoran has risen to decree a grand war of errantry against those who invaded his territories and put his servants to the sword.

The gourmand’s desire to gorge themselves, the painter’s obsession with creating a timeless masterpiece, the sadist’s need to mutilate their victims: all these things empower Slaanesh – even the favoured obsessions of his brethren gods, a fact that causes them all private disquiet. The result of this is that none can escape the temptations of Slaanesh. Yet those drawn into his service soon discover that their former vices no longer satisfy, leading them to pursue ever more outlandish and grotesque forms of self-fulfilment.\n\nSlaanesh’s domain in the Realm of Chaos is known as the Six Circles of Seduction. It appears as a series of concentric ring-lands, each embodying one of the god’s favourite indulgences: Avidity, Gluttony, Carnality, Paramountcy, Vainglory and Indolency. Within each circle await traps that undermine the will and sap the soul, imprisoning those who roam there in forms of eternal torment. If a traveller somehow breached all six circles, they would arrive at the Palace of Pleasure itself, where Slaanesh has overseen the most mind-bending of revels. Yet the god’s throne sits empty, for in the Age of Myth, Slaanesh was captured by the aelven gods and sealed in the Hidden Gloaming between Hysh and Ulgu.

When Scinari and Vanari take to the field in tandem, few foes can withstand such a concentration of excellence.\n\nBut the strength of the Lumineth has come at a price. Arrogance, lust for knowledge and their own obsessive temperament once saw them almost annihilate themselves in a cataclysmic civil war known as the Spirefall or Ocari Dara. Long-repressed emotions were unleashed in a wave of mania and fury that saw the daemons of hated Slaanesh pick through the fabric of reality. The ensuing fighting shredded the Realm of Light until it was a shell of its former self.\n\nOnly the wisdom of the Archmage Teclis granted the aelves a chance to reinvent themselves and make amends for their many sins. Along with Celennar, he taught his disciples how to bond with the deeply scarred spirits of Hysh. Thus were formed the aelementiri temples and their orders of warrior-monks, capable of communing with towering war-forms inhabited by Hysh’s most powerful spirits. Time will tell if the lessons of the past will continue to guide the Lumineth or if their own brilliance will once again blind them to an impending disaster.",

These musclebound, red-eyed killers want nothing more than to indulge their thirst for battle, time and time again, until their fists are raw and their tusks drip with blood. They worship the god Gorkamorka, who is essentially two deities blended into one: Gork, who is brutal but cunning, and Mork, who is cunning but brutal. In times of great strife, Gorkamorka will split into his component halves and have a good argument with himself, which has given rise to some orruk cultures who favour one of the deity’s aspects over the other.\n\nThe Kruleboyz worship Mork. Long-limbed and sinewy, they fight dirty at all times – to them, the win’s the thing, no matter how it’s earned, and they lie and cheat as easily as they draw breath. They will soften up their prey with scare tactics and even magic-laced miasmas before launching the killing attack. The Ironjawz, by contrast, embody the thuggish Gork. These orruks are walking hillocks of muscle and bad temper clad in half a ton of beaten pig-iron. As the shock troops of an orruk war charge, commonly known as a Waaagh!, they pride themselves on being bigger and tougher than everything else.\n\nThere are no races more ferocious, more bestial of spirit or better suited to a life of constant hardship than the orruks. Each new offensive brought against them is a thing of joy, as establishing supremacy and shattering the grip of civilisation is the greatest of victories. When they join their voices in a wordless bellow of battle-lust, the pulsing green energy of their deity Gorkamorka turns their fractious tribes from a rabble into an unstoppable wave of violence.

When that war is won, they shall build a new empire of sterile control, purged of the delusion of free will. Led by the military genius Orpheon Katakros, they advance across the Mortal Realms, subjugating region after region with merciless efficiency.\n\nBonereapers may be dead things, but these are no unthinking automata. Each contains a composite essence, created from the splicing together of multiple soul-slivers. Traits such as obedience, hatred and ruthlessness are maintained, whilst humour, mercy and kindness are stripped away, for such concepts are alien to Nagash. This process gives rise to superlative warriors capable of enacting the orders of their superiors in a way that mindless undead would find impossible. Yet there is one material above all that is critical to the Ossiarch war machine: the very bone from which their bodies are shaped.\n\nTo ensure a steady supply of this vital resource, the Bonereapers subject their conquered provinces to a grotesque tax: the Bone-tithe. Mortisan heralds approach cities and strongpoints with a phalanx of undead soldiers at their back and in graven tones issue a demand for skeletal matter, to be delivered to them before an allotted date. If the tithe is not fulfilled in time, it will be taken by force. Thus, living vassals are kept in a permanent state of terror, forced to continuously sacrifice a portion of their own people to satisfy the Ossiarchs’ needs – or else be wiped out.

They consort with daemons, fight alongside the most grotesque monsters of the wastelands and wear baroque armour that is often irrevocably melded to their very flesh. These are the true champions of Chaos, each the equal of several lesser mortals. These warriors follow the Path to Glory as they ravage the realms – especially as the Hour of Ruin tolls and a tide of ruinous carnage spills forth to drown Sigmar’s weakling empire in darkness.",

Though famously cowardly, they are sent into a wild frenzy beneath the gaze of their deity, the Bad Moon – a weird planetoid that spreads insanity and flesh-warping magic with its sickly light. Wherever the Bad Moon rises, hordes of whooping grots bubble up to the surface, accompanied by stomping cave beasts and gargantuan arachnids. The unpredictability of these anarchic armies is matched only by the violence they inflict on anyone who draws their attention.\n\nThroughout the realms exist many different grot subcultures, supposedly formed after a schism between their ancestors during the Age of Myth. Those that could not stand the light of Hysh swaddled themselves in black robes and fled into the cavernous depths, becoming the Moonclans. Others settled in the deep woods and formed an alliance with the intelligent arachnids that lurked therein; these were the ancestors of the Spiderfang grots. Finally, those less afraid of Hysh’s glow prowled the open steppes mounted atop snarling lupines, becoming the Gitmobs.\n\nAt first glance, it would be easy to dismiss the Gloomspite Gitz. One might scoff at the natural cowardice and treachery of the grots, the mindless ferocity of their squigs and the legendary stupidity of the cavern-dwelling troggoths. The grots that make up the majority of their armies lack the natural aggression of the orruks or the sheer bulk of the ogors. Yet this apparent weakness is a mirage – one that the grots have learned to use to their advantage. They are cunning and vindictive in the extreme, their deranged minds forever spinning with ploys to undermine those who look down upon them. Within every grot lies the spiteful desire to succeed no matter the odds, and their cruelty knows no limits.",

These are the Stormcast Eternals, Sigmar’s chosen champions in this era of turmoil.

Here, too, is where Sigmar Heldenhammer holds court, watching the progress of his people from above and deploying his demigod soldiers in times of need.\n\nFor these warriors, death is not the end. Should they be slain, their souls return to Azyr in a burst of celestial force, whereupon they are excruciatingly made whole again and cast once more into the fray in a process known as Reforging. Their immortality is as much a curse as a blessing, their fate to die again and again at Sigmar’s behest, more of their souls stripped away with each death until they are more akin to their unfeeling hammers than their former selves.\n\nMany and contradictory are the names used to describe these warriors – preservers, destroyers, angels, abominations, blessed, cursed – but on one thing do all agree: they are the Stormcast Eternals, and they are the will of the heavens made manifest.",
